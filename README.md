The goal of this project was to serve as an introduction to making classes in Python. This project contains two classes, one of those classes will represent an amount of currency (a real-world thing you can point to), and the second will represent a currency converter (arguably a real-world person, but actually a set of procedures). Methods to add, subtract, and multiply currencies were added to enhance the usability of the program.  There were also methods put into place to ensure that multiple input types could be converted before using any of the computational methods stated earlier.
