# Currency converter

### Description
The goal of this project was to serve as an introduction to making classes in Python. This project contains two classes, one of those classes will represent an amount of currency (a real-world thing you can point to), and the second will represent a currency converter (arguably a real-world person, but actually a set of procedures). Methods to add, subtract, and multiply currencies were added to enhance the usability of the program.  There were also methods put into place to ensure that multiple input types could be converted before using any of the computational methods stated earlier.

### Files Included

* currency.py
  * Includes methods to add, subtract, multiply and determine if two currencies are the same.  
  * If the two currency codes are not the same, an error is raised.
  * Includes method to change the currency symbol into currency code.
  * Includes method to remove symbol from currency.
* currency_test.py
  * Includes tests that were used to drive the development of functions included in currency.py file.
* currency_converter.py
  * Includes method to convert one currency amount to another currency amount.
* currency_converter_test.py
  * Includes tests that were used to drive the development of functions included in currency_converter.py file.
